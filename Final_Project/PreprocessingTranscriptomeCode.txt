# Download the transcriptome data set and reference genome files (as .fna, .fasta, and .gff) from the link on Canvas. The transcriptome data set is 8 total samples, 2 replicates of planktonically grown P. aeruginosa and 2 replicates of biofilm P. aeruginosa each with a forward (pass 1) and reverse (pass 2) read. The .fna, .fasta, and .gff files should be directly in your folder for transcriptome work. The reads will be in a folder called fastq in your transcriptome folder.

# Unzips files in fastq folder  
gunzip fastq/*.gz

# Prepare the genome file
hisat2-build GalGal.fna Gallusg

# Align reads to genome and assemble the transcripts #you will need to do these commands for every pair of reads (there are 4 in the tutorial). As an example, this is the command I ran for the plank01 sample.

hisat2 -q -x Gallusg -1 fastq/Day2101_F.fastq -2 fastq/Day2101_R.fastq -S Day2101.sam

# Convert the .sam file to a .bam file. As an example, this is the command I ran for the plank01sample. This .sam file is also large, so you can delete it once youâ€™ve created the .bam file.

samtools view -bS Day2101.sam > Day2101.bam

samtools view -bS Day3502.sam > Day3502.bam

# Convert the .bam to a sorted .bam. This compresses the file and sorts the variants for easier discovery. As an example, this is the command I ran for the plank01 sample. 

samtools sort Day2101.bam -o Day2101.sorted.bam
samtools sort Day2102.bam -o Day2102.sorted.bam
